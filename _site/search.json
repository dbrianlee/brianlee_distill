I am especially passionate about using academia as a vessel for social activism and looking at modern-day issues through a socioplitical lens.\nIn my free time, I love playing the cello – I’ve been playing for almost 8 years now! My favorite part of playing has to be the collaborative aspect because I love making music with other people. Here’s a project I did with my friend Annie at the start of quarantine. I also enjoy watching movies and listening to music. My favorite albums at the moment are Solar Power by Lorde, Devotion by Beach House, and Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers.\nMy cat Spooky and my cello!My dog Charles getting ready for a nap.A stunning sunset at Hawks Nest in Sparrow Bush, NYEducation:\nCandidate for a BA in Applied Math & Statistics and International Studies (Political Science disciplinary focus), Community & Global Health Concentrator Macalester College\nFor more information about my professional interests and work experience, please read through my resume!\nContact\nPlease reach me at my school email, blee1@macalester.edu or through my personal email at briandlee01@gmail.com!\n\n\n\n",
